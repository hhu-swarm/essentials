# Command Line

A command line enables users to interact with a system using commands. Unix basic command line interface is almost equal accross all major distributions of linux as well as macos.

The idea of a command line ist the following:
- a basic `shell`, which is just another application, runs on top of your operating system. The most common unix based shells are `shell`,`bash` and `zsh`. A shell allows users to interact with the internals of your device.
- access a shell using a `terminal` or other means like `ssh`
- wait for the shell to allow for input. Its often indicated with a `$` sign. Sometimes your current `directory` is displayed aswell
- type in a `command` like
    ```
    $ ls
    ```
- wait for the command to finish `execution`. During execution no input other than `interrupt` (CTRL+C, âŒ˜+C) and a few alternatives are possible. The application may choose to display `output` on the terminal during execution. It may also ask for other input during execution like
    ```
    type in your name: 
    ```
- the command finished executing as soon as a `$` is displayed again.
